# tinproject's Advent of Code 2018 solutions

This are my solutions to [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018). I started with some friends from H4ckademy with a private leaderboard and ends up solving 43 stars of 50, not bad having into account that nowadays I only code in YAML..

Advent's time is ending and I believe I fulfill my goals of refresh my Python and learn more about the Python's standard library, and this it's taking em too much time..

All code in this repo only uses a plain Python 3.7 install (apart from development dependencies: pytest & flake8)
